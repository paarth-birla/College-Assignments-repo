# Disk Scheduling Algorithms

* ### FCFS
    * #### FCFS is the simplest of all the Disk Scheduling Algorithms. In FCFS, the requests are addressed in the order they arrive in the disk queue.Let us understand this with the help of an example.

* ### SCAN
    * ####  In SCAN algorithm the disk arm moves into a particular direction and services the requests coming in its path and after reaching the end of disk, it reverses its direction and again services the request arriving in its path.
    * #### So, this algorithm works as an elevator and hence also known as elevator algorithm.
